This assignment is famous travelling salesman problem implemented using a-star algorithm.


Heuristic is chosen according to the Minimum Spanning tree which helps to give out path with minimum possible cost.

Compilation :
Enter no of cities
Enter the adjacency matrix to give distance between in each city

Program will then give output of the path for minimum cost and the cost along with it.
